# Fairhouse - Study Project on Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.7 following the [Angular](https://angular.io/quick-start#create-a-new-angular-app-from-the-command-line) instruction.

A housing app Fairhouse was built following the [Introduction to Angular](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/introduction-to-angular#0) codelab. The completed app allows users to view home listings based on their search and view details of a housing location.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Alternatively, you can run a dev server with the `npm start` command.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
